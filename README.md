ASTRA implemenation.

ASTRA is an agent programming language that is built on and integrated with the Java
Programming Language. ASTRA is an implementation of AgentSpeak(TR) a logic-based
agent programming language that combines AgentSpeak(L)

The system is designed to read an input from the user interface, to encrypt it, to
decrypt it and crack the password used in the encryption process. Multi-Agent System is an
alternative to centralised problem solving, because problems are themselves distributed and 
because the distribution of problem solving between different agents reveals itself to be more
efficient way to organise the problem solving - it can be exible and allow failures in
the system. For solving the problem agents cooperatively exchanging information as the
solution is developed.


The Vigenre cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of differ-
ent Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is a simple form of polyalphabetic
substitution.

The term Auto-Encipherment refers to ciphers in which the plaintext serves as its own
key-phrase in the performance of Vigenre cipher. To the initial key append the plaintext.
